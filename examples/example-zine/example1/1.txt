The {{color "purple" "floppy witch"}} was tinkering with her Lisp code when she ran into a bug that just wouldn't budge. With a sigh, she turned to her cat for help.

"What do you think, Fluffy?" she asked. The cat simply stared back, unimpressed. "Thanks for the input," the witch muttered sarcastically.

But as she continued to stare at her screen, an idea began to form. With a sly grin, she typed out a solution that was as clever as it was brilliant. The cat watched in confusion as the witch erupted in laughter.

"What did you do?" Fluffy asked.

"I just debugged my code with a pun!" the witch replied, still chuckling.

The cat rolled its eyes and went back to grooming, but the witch was beaming with {{rainbow "pride"}}. For in the world of programming, sometimes the best way to solve a problem is with a bit of silly wordplay.
